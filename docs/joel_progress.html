<h4>11/13</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fabrizio and I have (pre-)released the first version of our RPI.GPIO -> libgpiod compatibility layer.</li>
<li>Download the RPM <a href="https://github.com/underground-software/python3-libgpiod-rpi/releases/tag/v0.1">here</a>.</li>
<li>Go <a href="python3-libgpiod-rpi.html">here</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h4>10/20</h4>

<ul>
<li>Continued to work with Fabrizio on compatibility layer, just need to do event handling now</li>
<li>Discovered a warning thrown by the kernel when attempting to create an invalid proc dir via default behavior of <code>libgpiod/bindings/python/examples/gpiomon.py</code></li>
<li>The program passes <code>sys.argv[0]</code> to <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"><code>ioctl(2)</code></a>, which causes the kernel to throw a warning and the <code>/proc/irq/&lt;n&gt;/&lt;dirname&gt;/</code> directory not to be created</li>
<li>Event detection still works, but this is mildly not sane behavior. We will tweak the call to fix the issue on the libgpiod side</li>
<li>In addition, the warning was mildly cryptic, so we posted a patch to the <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/20/169">linux kernel mailing list</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>10/13</h4>

<ul>
<li>Working on RPi.GPIO -> libgpiod compatibility layer <a href="https://github.com/underground-software/libgpiod/tree/example_wrap">source</a></li>
<li>Patched upstream libgpiod config <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/commit/?id=9ed02fc793b332773658f3ba09f45a058e75b0a8">commit</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>9/30</h4>

<ul>
<li>We have <a href="known_issues.html">known</a> for some time that one cannot <code>git clone</code> the linux kernel to the device, as attemps to do so have resulted in git failing due to lack of RAM</li>
<li>I attempted to repartition my microSD card with a ~7.5GB partition of type <code>linux-swap</code> at the end and try again.</li>
<li>The <code>git clone</code> appeared to be making more progress than it did during previous attempts, but near the end of the "resolving deltas" stage, the device crashed</li>
<li>When I rebooted, systemd failed to mount the filesystems on the microSD card, which I believe was due to my forgetting to add an entry to <code>/etc/fstab</code> corresponding to new swap partiton.</li>
<li>There may be more to the problem than the above, but I then realized that I was acutally running the RPi 3 Model B V1.2 instead of our standard development device, the RPi 3 Model B+</li>
<li>I will try and redo my test on the latter device</li>
<li>I also identified the existing default swap space as not being disk-backed, see <code>/dev/zram0</code> in <a href="known_issues.html">known issues</a> for more information</li>
</ul>
