<h4>9/30</h4>

<ul>
<li>We have <a href="known_issues.html">known</a> for some time that once cannot <code>git clone</code> the linux kernel to the device, as attemps to do so have resulted in git failing due to lack of RAM</li>
<li>I attempted to repartition my microSD card with an ~7.5GB partition of type <code>linux-swap</code> at the end and try again.</li>
<li>The <code>git clone</code> appeared to be making more progress than it did during previous attempts, but near the end of the &ldquo;resolving deltas&rdquo; stage, the device crashed</li>
<li>When I rebooted, systemd failed to mount the filesystems on the microSD card, which I believe was due to my forgetting to add an entry to <code>/etc/fstab</code> corresponding to new swap partiton.</li>
<li>There may be more to the problem than the above, but I then realized that I was acutally running the RPi 3 Model B V1.2 instead of our standard development device, the RPi 3 Model B+</li>
<li>I will try and redo my test on the latter device</li>
<li>I also identified the existing default swap space as not being disk-backed, see <a href="known_issues.html">known issues</a> for more information</li>
</ul>
