<h4>10/10</h4>

<ul>
<li>Worked on creating a live-cd (Following the guide
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Livemedia-creator-_How_to_create_and_use_a_Live_CD">here</a>)
<ul>
<li>Installed mock, kickstart, and lmc</li>
<li>Cloned fedora kickstarts</li>
<li>Ran a mock chroot into base fedora-30-aarch64</li>
<li>copied kickstart files into chroot</li>
<li>Begain livemedia creation process, immediately ran into errors :^(</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>10/9</h4>

<ul>
<li>Audio works by installing <code>alsa-plugins-pulseaudio</code></li>
<li>I was unable to recreate any clipboard issues on enlightenment,
however Xterm doesn't have built in CLIPBOARD support and only
uses the PRIMARY buffer. This <em>could</em> be hacked in with an
<code>~/.Xresources</code> hack but we could also just use URXVT, terminator,
or any other terminal emulator that has native clipboard support since
it's \$CURRENT_YEAR.</li>
</ul>
