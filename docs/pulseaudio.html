<h2>pulseaudio</h2>

<h4>Summary:</h4>

<p>Pulseaudio isn&rsquo;t installed properly in the minimal Fedora Image,
and it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious how to setup, however installing a
package fixed it.</p>

<h4>Problem:</h4>

<p>Package <code>alsa-plugins-pulseaudio</code> and it&rsquo;s dependencies aren&rsquo;t installed</p>

<h4>Solution:</h4>

<p><code>bash
sudo yum install alsa-plugins-pulseaudio # Should resolve alsa and pulseaudio as deps
</code></p>
