#### 9/27

* Investigated i3wm and Englightenment DE.

* Investigated potentially useful [video driver](video_driver.html)

* Created a minimal image and [setup guide](setup_guide.html) for i3. 

* Studied implementation of libgpiod Python bindings, will focus on improving them and providing higher level abstractions to match RPi.GPIO library.

#### 10/4

* Revised installation procedure for desktop environments

* Investigated lightweight browsers to pair with Enlightenment.
	- Midori web browser seems promising but there is a problem with libEGL which affects QT applications like Midori.
Fixing this might be useful if it provides a usable browser.

#### 10/11

* Annoted libgpiod python bindings, looking into adding property attributes for the tools

* Looked into installing numpy and sense-hat, working on a minimal dependency list.

* Working on compatibility layer for RPi.GPIO code and libgpiod
